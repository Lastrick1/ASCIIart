# ASCIIart
Summary: Python code to convert image file to ASCII

This code takes a file path and, if file is found, prompts the user for inputs (namely, number of ASCII lines and adjustment to contrast) before converting the image to ASCII. The resulting ASCII code is written to the same directory with text extension (.txt).

Initial framework for conversion steps can be found here: https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-generate-ascii-art-from-image-using-python

Requires Python Image Library (specifically Pillow), found here: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
